1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,390
The most widely used invasive treatment

2
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:14,970
to treat angina or coronary artery disease

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,870
are percutaneous coronary intervention.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,460
P c I also called percutaneous transluminal

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,150
coronary angioplasty, P T C A, and.

6
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,375
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

7
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,845
in C A B G.

8
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,555
The surgeon will bypass

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,085
the blockage using grafts.

10
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,625
One end of the graft is attached

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,785
to the aorta and the other to the

12
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:46,065
coronary artery beyond the blockage.

13
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,644
The surgery is done by many methods

14
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:54,105
in the traditional form of bypass surgery.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,400
The surgeon makes a vertical

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,920
incision on the chest to expose it.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,100
The breast bone is cut

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,450
using an electric sore.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,120
The heart can be seen beating in the chest

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,180
during the surgery.

21
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:24,045
The heart is called and stopped so that

22
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:26,085
the surgeon can perform the surgery easily.

23
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,515
The oxygen requirement

24
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,265
of the heart decreases.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,095
During this period.

26
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,304
The function of the heart and the lungs is

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,884
taken over by the heart lung bypass machine.

28
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,824
This machine is controlled by a technician.

29
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,425
The profusionist simultaneously,

30
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,435
depending upon the number of bypass

31
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:47,595
grafts needed, another surgeon will

32
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:49,755
dissect and remove the vein from the.

33
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:52,365
Arm or vorax.

34
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,574
This process is called harvesting.

35
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,774
The graft taken from the

36
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,755
leg is of the sphs vein.

37
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:06,405
The arterial grafts are from the forearm

38
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,465
called the radial or ulna artery.

39
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,605
The veins or arteries for grafting

40
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,005
can also be harvested, endoscopic.

41
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,615
Where a small incision is made to remove

42
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:23,325
the vein or artery for grafting, many

43
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,205
times an artery from the chest wall is also

44
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,845
used, called the internal memory artery.

45
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,605
One end of the graft is stitched to the

46
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:34,425
largest artery arising from the heart called

47
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:37,725
the aorta, and the other end is stitched

48
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,245
beyond the blockage on the coronary artery,

49
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,725
thus creating a new channel for the blood.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,260
After the surgery is completed, the bypass

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,780
machine is slowly switched off and the heart

52
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,960
is restarted using drugs and electric shock.

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
The chest wall is then closed.

54
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,410
The patient is then shifted to the intensive

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,840
cardiac care unit for further management.

56
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,100
C A B G is also performed using advanced

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,650
techniques like minimally invasive surgery.

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,820
Here the surgery is done

59
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,340
through small incisions.

60
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,965
The surgery is suitable for patients

61
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:16,304
requiring one to two bypasses in the

62
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,954
arteries on the front of the heart.

63
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:22,785
In some of the cases, an advanced

64
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,315
technique called beating heart

65
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,265
or off pump surgery is performed.

66
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:30,424
It is performed using a stabilizing

67
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,415
device to restrict the movement of

68
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:34,605
small segments of the heart while the

69
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,285
patient's heart continues to beat.

70
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,255
This allows the surgeon to operate

71
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,635
without the use of the heart lung.

72
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,910
Used in conventional cardiac surgeries, some

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,640
changes in lifestyle helps manage angina.

74
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,100
It is important to exercise regularly,

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,019
have regular checkups with a

76
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,200
doctor for blood pressure and for

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,630
complications of hypertension, manage

78
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,850
stress levels effectively and take

79
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,620
prescribed medication regularly.
