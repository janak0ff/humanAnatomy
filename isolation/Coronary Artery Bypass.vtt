00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.390
The most widely used invasive treatment

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:14.970
to treat angina or coronary artery disease

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.870
are percutaneous coronary intervention.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.460
P c I also called percutaneous transluminal

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
coronary angioplasty, P T C A, and.

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.375
Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:34.845
in C A B G.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.555
The surgeon will bypass

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.085
the blockage using grafts.

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.625
One end of the graft is attached

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.785
to the aorta and the other to the

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.065
coronary artery beyond the blockage.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.644
The surgery is done by many methods

00:00:51.974 --> 00:00:54.105
in the traditional form of bypass surgery.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.400
The surgeon makes a vertical

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.920
incision on the chest to expose it.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.100
The breast bone is cut

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.450
using an electric sore.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.120
The heart can be seen beating in the chest

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.180
during the surgery.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:24.045
The heart is called and stopped so that

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:26.085
the surgeon can perform the surgery easily.

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:28.515
The oxygen requirement

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:30.265
of the heart decreases.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.095
During this period.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:34.304
The function of the heart and the lungs is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.884
taken over by the heart lung bypass machine.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.824
This machine is controlled by a technician.

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:43.425
The profusionist simultaneously,

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.435
depending upon the number of bypass

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:47.595
grafts needed, another surgeon will

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.755
dissect and remove the vein from the.

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:52.365
Arm or vorax.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.574
This process is called harvesting.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.774
The graft taken from the

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.755
leg is of the sphs vein.

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:06.405
The arterial grafts are from the forearm

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.465
called the radial or ulna artery.

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.605
The veins or arteries for grafting

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:16.005
can also be harvested, endoscopic.

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:18.615
Where a small incision is made to remove

00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:23.325
the vein or artery for grafting, many

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:26.205
times an artery from the chest wall is also

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.845
used, called the internal memory artery.

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:31.605
One end of the graft is stitched to the

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:34.425
largest artery arising from the heart called

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.725
the aorta, and the other end is stitched

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.245
beyond the blockage on the coronary artery,

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.725
thus creating a new channel for the blood.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.260
After the surgery is completed, the bypass

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.780
machine is slowly switched off and the heart

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.960
is restarted using drugs and electric shock.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.080
The chest wall is then closed.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.410
The patient is then shifted to the intensive

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.840
cardiac care unit for further management.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.100
C A B G is also performed using advanced

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.650
techniques like minimally invasive surgery.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.820
Here the surgery is done

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.340
through small incisions.

00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:13.965
The surgery is suitable for patients

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:16.304
requiring one to two bypasses in the

00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:17.954
arteries on the front of the heart.

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:22.785
In some of the cases, an advanced

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:24.315
technique called beating heart

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.265
or off pump surgery is performed.

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:30.424
It is performed using a stabilizing

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.415
device to restrict the movement of

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:34.605
small segments of the heart while the

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:36.285
patient's heart continues to beat.

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:39.255
This allows the surgeon to operate

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:40.635
without the use of the heart lung.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.910
Used in conventional cardiac surgeries, some

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.640
changes in lifestyle helps manage angina.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.100
It is important to exercise regularly,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.019
have regular checkups with a

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.200
doctor for blood pressure and for

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.630
complications of hypertension, manage

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.850
stress levels effectively and take

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.620
prescribed medication regularly.
