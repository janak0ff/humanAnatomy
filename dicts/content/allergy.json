Leukotriene modifiers block the action of leukotrienes and prevent airway narrowing and mucus production, and hence they are used as preventive medications. ",

The spirometer is connected to a computer that records the volume of air exhaled in one second - forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and the total amount of air exhaled - forced vital capacity (FVC). FEV1\/FVC ratio is the primary measurement to identify obstructive impairment of the airways. Spirometry is simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive and can be carried out as an out-patient procedure.
