Arthrography procedure involves X-ray using fluoroscopy and a contrast material usually containing iodine and sometimes supplemented by air. During the procedure contrast material is injected into the joint and the joint space is examined with a fluoroscope and X-rays are taken. The images are then monitored, most often, on a computer screen. This procedure is most often used to study the abnormalities in shoulders, Knee, hip, wrist and ankle. ",
