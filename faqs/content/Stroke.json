            "AnswerText": "A \"mini-stroke\" is a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). TIA results from the temporary interruption of blood flow to part of the brain causing temporary impairment of brain function that lasts for a few minutes. TIA is mostly ischemic; caused by the blood clot formed in the artery of the brain. Symptoms include temporary loss of vision and speech, dizziness, weakness or tingling in the limbs (arm or leg). A mini stroke does not cause brain damage but they are the warning signs of subsequent major stroke. "

Hemorrhage causes internal bleeding and accumulation of blood around the tissue. This increases the pressure on the tissue and damages it. Hemorrhage can occur due to external causes such as injury to the head or internal causes such as weak blood vessel walls, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, etc. "

            "AnswerText": "A blood clot is a clump of blood cells, clotting factors and other substances. A blood clot occurs in response to damages in blood vessels, involving platelets and clotting factors to form a mesh of needle like fibers to trap blood cells and plug the damaged portion. Thus formed blood clot can hinder the blood supply to the surrounding tissues causing stroke. Blood clots formed in one part of the body can detach and travel to other parts of the body and block the blood vessels resulting in stroke. "

The two types of hemorrhagic stroke are intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracerbral hemorrhage occurs when the blood vessel within the brain burst because of high blood pressure. The accumulation of the blood in the brain increases the pressure within the skull and damages the brain tissue. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when the blood vessel just outside the brain bursts and the blood accumulates in the subarachnoid space (the area between the brain and the skull). "

Fatty deposits known as plaque can build up in the blood vessels and narrows the artery of the brain. High LDL cholesterol or �bad cholesterol� in the blood causes fatty deposition in the blood vessels. Normally, the white blood cells responsible for the body's defense digest the LDL cholesterol. Overtime the accumulation of these cholesterol, cells and debris deposit on the walls of the arteries to form plaque and narrows the arteries by the process called arthrosclerosis.

As a result of the damage, particular body functions controlled by that part of the brain get affected. The extent of damage caused by stroke varies from person to person. Damage due to stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities. It also depends on the extent of damage and the part of the brain that is affected. Complications of stroke include: � Paralysis: Paralysis or loss of muscle movement results from lack of blood flow to the brain. Stroke can cause paralysis on one side of the body, resulting in loss of control of certain muscles of the body, usually facial muscles� Difficulty in talking\/swallowing: Due to a stroke, the person may have less control over the movement of muscles, especially muscles of the mouth and throat, making it difficult to talk, swallow or eat. Speech may also be affected due to aphasia, a condition wherein a person has difficulty expressing him\/herse. � Loss of memory or trouble with understanding: Memory loss is common in stroke victims. Some may experience difficulty in making judgments, reasoning and also in understanding concts. � Pain: Some may experience pain, numbness or tingling sensations in the stroke affected parts of the body. They may become sensitive to temperature changes, especially extreme cold, a condition known as central stroke pain or central pain syndromeCPS). � Behavioral changes: Stroke can cause people to become withdrawn and less social, sometimes impulsive. They may lose the ability to care for themselves and may need a caretaker to help them with their grooming needs and dailchores. "

Spells of dizziness, inability to walk, loss of balance or coordination, and severe headache with no known cause. A past personal history as well as family history also helps in diagnosing stroke.

A CT scan involves a series of X-rays that can show if and where there is bleeding. This is vital in not only diagnosing but also differentiating between ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is useful to determine the extent of damage done to the brain and therefore is useful to predict recovery. EEG (Electroencephalogram) is used to record electrical activity of the brain. Other tests recommended for ischemic stroke are ECG (Electrocardiogram) to check for heart problems. "

Laboratory tests include CBC, blood sugar levels, blood lipid tests, electrolytes, liver and kidney function tests and coagulation tests. A CBC or complete blood count is a routine test which is used to determine the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in blood. Coagulation tests include PT (Prothrombin Time), PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time), and INR (International Normalized Ratio). These tests measure how rapidly blood clots can be formed. An abnormality could result in excessive bleeding or excessive clotting. The blood lipid tests include cholesterol level, total lipids level, HDL and LDL levels.

Drug tPA is an intravenous drug administered within the first three hours after stroke symptoms surface. There are a few new drugs which are under trail that can reverse the brain damage if administered immediately after a stroke. Drugs such as aspirin warfarin and heparin are used commonly for emergency treatment and also used in preventive treatment.
