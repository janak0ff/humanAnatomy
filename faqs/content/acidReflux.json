            "AnswerText": "Stomach acid or the gastric acid, is a digestive fluid  that is produced by cells lining the stomach. It is composed of hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride and potassium chloride. Stomach acid  plays a very vital role  in digestion of the food by activating digestive enzymes for the breakdown process. Some of the other stomach cells also produce mucous which acts as a physical barrier to prevent the stomach acid from causing damage to the stomach."

            "QuestionText": "Why does the acid go back up into the esophagus?",
            "AnswerText": "Back flow ( reflux) of acid and stomach contents into the esophagus is normally prevented by the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). LES is a ring of muscle that is located at the junction where the stomach and esophagus meet. This sphincter acts as a drawstring to open or close the opening between the esophagus and stomach, thus preventing acid reflux. Normally,LES relaxes during swallowing process and then tightens up to prevent the backflow of food.In the case of acid reflux or GERD, the LES relaxes between swallows which allow the stomach contents and corrosive acid to go back up into the esophagus causing irritation to the lining of the esophagus."

            "AnswerText": "The organs of the chest are separated from the abdomen by a sheet of muscle called diaphragm which has a natural opening known as the hiatus that allows the esophagus to pass through. Hiatal hernia is a condition that develops when the upper part of the stomach juts out above the diaphragm and into the chest through the hiatus. Hiatal hernia can occur due to persistent cough, vomiting, straining, or sudden physical exertion.  Formation of hiatal hernia easily helps the  stomach acid to go back up into the esophagus.People aged 50 and above who r symptomatic to GERD are likely to develop hiatal hernia."

            "AnswerText": "Heartburn occurs more at night and can be considered to be more severe form of GERD. Pain usually worsens when lying down because it becomes easier for the stomach acid to get into the esophagus allowing them to stand longer in esophagus than during the day reflux. This results in more damage of the esophagus. Besides, the swallowing of saliva gets suppressed during sleep and so the movement of esophagus decreases. Nighttime heartburn can cause awakening at night, sleep loss, high blood pressure, overweight and tiredness."

            "AnswerText": "Acid reflux is more common in pregnant ladies because of mainly two aspects: firstly a change in hormonal imbalance could bring a difference in functioning of the digestive system. The hormone that is produced during pregnancy causes all the muscles of the body to relax including LES valve which helps the acid to reflux Secondly, the weight of the growing baby puts more pressure on the stomach and as a result the acid backs up into the esophagus."

            "AnswerText": "A 24-hour pH esophageal monitoring test is used to measure the strength of the stomach acid present in esophagus for 24hours. A small tube called catheter attached with a sensor at the tip is passed through the nose and positioned in esophagus. The other end of the catheter is attached to a recorder and exposed outside the body. When there is an acid reflux occurring back into the esophagus, the sensor gets stimulated and the episode of reflux is recorded by the recorder. After 24hours the catheter is removed and the recorder is analyzed. "

Antacids containing carbonates taken in regular high doses may cause alkalosis and in turn results in altered excretion of other drugs. They can also induce the formation of kidney stones. A chemical reaction between carbonates and hydrochloric acid (main content of stomach acid) may produce carbon dioxide that could cause headache or decrease in muscle flexibility. An increase in sodium intake could be harmful for hypertension, heart failure and many other conditions like renal disorders etc. Antacids can alter bowel functions causing diarrhea or constipation problems."

            "AnswerText": "Histamine antagonists or H2 antagonists are kind of acid blockers that operate by blocking the chemical pathways that allow histamine (a chemical stimulant) to trigger the stomach-acid producing cells to initiate acid production. They are primarily used for the treatment of heartburn symptom in GERD that are not associated with any of the complications. H2 antagonists are usually taken 30 minutes before meals and can also be taken at bedtime to suppress the nighttime production of acid."

            "AnswerText": "If acid blockers do not relieve symptoms, there are stronger drugs available such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI). A PPI blocks the proton pump reaction in the final phase of acid secretion by the stomach-acid secreting cells thus inhibiting the production of acid completely for a longer period of time.. PPIs are usually prescribed if other drugs have not helped. PPIs can treat both the symptoms and the complications of GERD and thus carry the tag for most preferred drug among all the acid-blockers. They are usually taken an hour before the meals since the PPIs work best in high acid level which occurs after meals. "

            "AnswerText": "Sometimes the drugs that are administered for GERD patients turn out to be not effective and under these circumstances surgery is the only recommended treatment. The surgical procedure to prevent acid reflux is called anti-reflux surgery or fundoplication and is done through laparoscopy. During anti-reflex surgery, the upper curve of the stomach called the fundus is wrapped around the esophagus and sewn into place so that the lower portion of the esophagus passes through a small tunnel of stomach muscle. This surgery helps to strengthen the valve between the esophagus and the LES which could stop acid reflux into the esophagus and allows esophagus to heal. This surgery also repairs hiatal hernia. The option of surgery has relieved majority of the GERD patients from their complications and proved effective in treating their symptoms for at least 5 to 10 years. Surgery may or may not completely eliminate the usage of acid reflux drugs in some of the GERD post operated patients."

            "AnswerText": "Most often lifestyle changes can make a difference by drastically reducing symptoms in GERD sufferers.A few recommended lifestyle changes are: 1. Avoid a meal immediately before bedtime. A time gap of at least 3 hours is recommended. This allows the stomach to empty its contents and so acid production decreases. 2. Don't lie down immediately after eating at any time of the day.3. If you have to lie down after a meal, use a few pillows to keep your head elevated at about 6 inches. This helps in preventing reflux. 4. Avoid large meals, especially before bed. 5. Avoid fatty foods. These foods can irritate the already damaged esophagus.6. Avoid alcohol without eating food. Also avoid alcohol before going to bed, as 7. alcohol can increase the process of regurgitation.8. Stop smoking, as smoking weakens the LES and increases chances of reflux.9. If obese or overweight, try to shed off excess pounds.10. Maintain good posture. Always stand upright or sit up straight. This helps food and acid pass through the stomach instead of backing up into the esophagus.11. The above said lifestyle changes can minimize the GERD symptoms to some extent and sometimes incorporation with antacids or acid blockers can be helpful."
